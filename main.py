# ========== WIRING ==========
#
#   Display         Pico 2 W
#   -------         --------
#   VCC        ->   3V3(OUT)  (pin 36)
#   GND        ->   GND       (pin 38 or any GND)
#   SCL (SCK)  ->   GP18      (SPI0 SCK, pin 24)
#   SDA (MOSI) ->   GP19      (SPI0 TX,  pin 25)
#   CS         ->   GP17      (SPI0 CSn, pin 22)
#   DC         ->   GP16      (pin 21)
#   RST        ->   GP20      (pin 26)
#   BLK        ->   GP21      (pin 27, PWM brightness control)
#
#   DRV5055A3QLPGM (TO-92, LPG package)
#   -----------------------------------
#   VCC        ->   3V3(OUT)  (pin 36), 100 nF to GND right at the sensor
#   GND        ->   GND
#   OUT        ->   GP26      (ADC0, pin 31), 1k series + 10 nF to GND at
#                             the Pico end if the run is longer than a few cm
#
#   Confirm pin order against the LPG drawing in the datasheet before you
#   solder. Magnet polarity does not matter: the scaling below is a signed
#   interpolation between two calibrated points, so a magnet facing the
#   other way just gives you a negative span.

# ========== PROTOCOL (matches the STM32 build as is) ==========
#
#   Pico -> STM32   "T{:05.1f}\n"   20 Hz, throttle percent
#
#   STM32 -> Pico   "<lead>,<st><fl>,<t10>,<rpm>,<idc>,<vb10>,<ia>,<ib>,<ic>\n"
#     lead   'S' normal build, 'L' LAB_TEST_MODE build
#     st     FOC state 0..5 (CAL IDLE ALIGN OPEN_LOOP CLOSED_LOOP FAULT)
#     fl     fault code 0..4 (none PHASE_OC OVERTEMP ACS_SAT DCLINK_OC)
#     t10    module temperature, tenths of a degree, 9999 = NTC fault
#     rpm    mechanical rpm, see RPM below
#     idc    DC link amps, -9999 = HASS never calibrated
#     vb10   bus volts in tenths, negative = bus sense fault
#     ia/ib/ic  per-phase RMS amps over a 100 ms window
#
#   The STM32 also sends "D,..." debug frames. This remote ignores them on
#   purpose. Nothing on this screen depends on them.
#
# ========== RPM, WHAT THE NUMBER ACTUALLY IS ==========
#
#   There is no encoder, so no RPM on this board is a measurement.
#     OPEN_LOOP    firmware sends the COMMANDED ramp speed. The rotor is
#                  being dragged and may not be following it.
#                  Shown as "commanded".
#     CLOSED_LOOP  firmware sends the PLL speed from the back-EMF observer.
#                  Shown as "estimated".
#     other states firmware sends 0 whether or not the prop is turning, so a
#                  coasting prop would read 0. Shown as "--" and
#                  "not tracked" rather than a false zero.
#
# ========== THROTTLE SENSING ==========
#
#   A DRV5055A3 is ratiometric and bipolar. With no field it sits at VCC/2
#   and moves 0.5 % of VCC per mT (the A3 is 25 mV/mT at 5 V). The sensor
#   runs off the same 3V3 rail that feeds ADC_VREF, so what the ADC sees is
#   that ratio and supply drift cancels. That is why COUNTS_PER_MT below has
#   no 3.3 in it and why the rail being 3.28 V does not shift the throttle.
#
#   Unlike a pot there are no end stops defining the range, so both ends of
#   travel are numbers you calibrate once and anything outside them is a
#   fault, not a throttle position. That is the one real gain over the pot:
#   a pot that loses its wiper wire reads as a valid position, this cannot.
#
# ========== CALIBRATING THE HALL THROTTLE ==========
#
#   Set HALL_CAL = True, run, watch the REPL.
#     1. Trigger released     -> B_REST_MT
#     2. Trigger at the stop  -> B_FULL_MT
#   Either can be negative and B_FULL can be below B_REST.
#   Aim for at least 30 mT of span. Keep BOTH ends at least 10 mT away from
#   0 mT, because a rest point sitting near 0 mT is indistinguishable from a
#   magnet that has fallen off its carrier. Keep the whole band inside
#   +-85 mT, which is where an A3 stays linear on a 3.3 V supply.
#   Then set HALL_CAL = False.
#
# ========== THROTTLE LOCK ==========
#
#   After every (re)connect the remote sends 0 % until the throttle has been
#   released below ARM_BELOW_PCT. Without this, a BLE dropout while holding
#   the throttle open would restart the drive the instant the link came
#   back. The display shows LOCK while this is holding.
#
#   A Hall fault also disarms, so clearing one needs a fresh release too.
#
# ========== WHAT KEEPS THIS FROM BREAKING ==========
#
#   1. aioble keeps only ONE pending notification per characteristic and
#      overwrites it. The HM-10 sends 20-byte notifications, so every frame
#      arrives in two or more pieces, often in the same connection event, and
#      the first piece is overwritten before any task can read it.
#      The queue is widened to NOTIFY_QUEUE_LEN, BUT char.notified() MUST NOT
#      be used with a widened queue. It only raises its wake flag when the
#      queue goes from empty to one item, and the flag is cleared when the
#      waiting task resumes. A second piece that lands between the IRQ and
#      that resume leaves one item queued with the flag clear, the next
#      notified() waits forever, and no later notification can wake it
#      because the queue is never empty again. Telemetry freezes while the
#      throttle writes keep working. That is the NO TLM fault.
#      So the receiver POLLS the queue every RX_POLL_MS and never waits on
#      the flag. If a future aioble renames the queue, it falls back to
#      notified() on the default one-slot queue: lossy, but cannot deadlock.
#      Glyphs are cached so a redraw does not starve the poll.
#   2. The old disconnect call passed timeout_ms to asyncio.wait_for, which
#      raised TypeError into a bare except, so the Pico never actually
#      disconnected. The HM-10 then stayed connected and stopped advertising,
#      and the rescan could not find it. Now awaited directly.
#   3. A malformed byte in a notification used to raise out of the receiver
#      and kill it silently while the throttle kept writing, leaving the
#      screen stale forever. Bad lines are now dropped one at a time, and if
#      the receiver ever does exit the link is torn down and rebuilt.
#   4. A single failed throttle write no longer drops the link.
#   4b. Backstop: if no valid status frame has arrived for RX_SILENT_MS AND
#      the throttle being sent is closed, the link is rebuilt. It never does
#      this with the throttle open, because silent telemetry is a display
#      fault and cutting thrust on the water over it would be worse.
#   5. The screen repaints all furniture and fields every REFRESH_MS without
#      clearing it, so a corrupted cell cannot persist.
#   6. Every Hall sample is a median of three reads and is range checked.
#      A reading outside the calibrated travel plus B_MARGIN_MT for
#      HALL_BAD_N samples in a row means lost supply, open OUT, dead sensor
#      or a lost magnet: throttle goes to 0, the arm flag drops and the
#      screen shows HALL in red. Clearing it needs HALL_GOOD_N good samples
#      AND a release, and the filter is seeded with the live reading on
#      recovery so a stale 0 % can never be what arms it. The BLE link is
#      deliberately left up, because 0 % at 20 Hz stops the drive more
#      gracefully than dropping the link and waiting out the dead-man.
